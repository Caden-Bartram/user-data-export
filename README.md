# user-data-export
The goal of this repository is to explore exporting data from a user's specified choices from given options to a named file that may be retrieved in a later project.

This objective will be sought out in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022, where I hope to create a fun project that takes user input in the form of assigning traits to a character, like the creation of a character for a dungeons and dragons campaign. The only visual component will be prompts in the console.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Accept Character's name
Accept Character's title
Accept Character's affinity
Accept Character's talent
Accept Character's skill
Accept Character's interest
Accept Character's hobby/hobbies

# user-data-export
The goal of this repository is to explore exporting data from a user's specified choices from given options to a named file that may be retrieved in a later project.

This objective will be sought out in the Godot game engine version 4.4.1-stable_win64x, where I hope to utilize the engine to create a fun project that takes user input in the form of assigning traits to a character, like the creation of a character for a dungeons and dragons campaign.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Accept Character's name
Accept Character's title
Accept Character's affinity
Accept Character's talent
Accept Character's skill
Accept Character's interest
Accept Character's hobby/hobbies
